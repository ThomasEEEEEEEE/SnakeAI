# SnakeAI

This project contains a functioning AI that plays the classic game Snake. This AI operates using an algorithm that utilizes hamiltonian cycles to optimize movements while ensuring safe moves. More information on the algorithm is given in the header comment of the main program.

This project contains two solutions. One of them is a program to create custom hamiltonian cycles and export them to text files. These text files are then read by the AI program and used to fuel the Snake AI algorithm. Instructions and controls for each program are located in the respective header comments.
